     YOU AGREE THAT ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
     OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR ANY SAMPLES OR PRODUCTS
     OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH SUCH USE, SHALL BE LITIGATED IN THE CIRCUIT COURT
     OF LOUISA, VIRGINIA, OR THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT
     OF VIRGINIA. YOU ARE EXPRESSLY SUBMITTING AND CONSENTING IN ADVANCE TO
     SUCH JURISDICTION IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OF SUCH COURTS, AND
     ARE WAIVING ANY CLAIM THAT MINERAL, VIRGNIA OR THE DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA<b><i> </i></b>IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM OR AN IMPROPER FORUM BASED ON LACK OF
     VENUE. This site is created and controlled by Southern Exposure Seed
     Exchange in the State of Virginia, USA. As such, the laws of Virginia will
     govern the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and elsewhere
     throughout the Site, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts
     of laws.</li><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Lapsed Accounts</strong>:
     In order to keep Southern Exposure Seed Exchange<b><i> </i></b>accounts current,
     if you or a representative of your business does not access his or her
     account or place an order with Southern Exposure Seed Exchange for a
     period of 730 days or more, Southern Exposure Seed Exchange<b><i> </i></b>may, in its sole discretion, terminate your account. Southern
     Exposure Seed Exchange<b><i> </i></b>will endeavor to notify you or
     your business of Southern Exposure Seed Exchange's<b><i> </i></b>intent to terminate
     your account by notice to your provided email address at least 30 days
     prior to deactivation. If the Member fails to respond to such email notice
     within 30 days after the day it is sent by Southern Exposure Seed
     Exchange, your account will be terminated as noted above. Therefore,
     Southern Exposure Seed Exchange<b><i> </i></b>strongly recommends that all
     Members keep their accounts and contact data current and in use. While
     Southern Exposure Seed Exchange desires to prevent active accounts from
     being terminated prematurely, Southern Exposure Seed Exchange<b><i> </i></b>has no obligation to maintain accounts that appear to Southern
     Exposure Seed Exchange<b><i> </i></b>to have been abandoned. Each
     Member agrees that failure to access his or her account for 730 days or
     more conclusively indicates that such Member's account has been abandoned
     and that the account may therefore be terminated. </li></ol></div>
